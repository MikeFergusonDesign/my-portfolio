        <h1>hi, i'm mike ferguson</h1>
        <g>Born and raised in a small town, I’ve always been drawn to the way people interact with their surroundings. Growing up in a close-knit community shaped my approach to design—focusing on accessibility, clarity, and intuitive experiences that bring people together. </g>
        <g>Working at the only Tim Hortons in town taught me the value of collaboration, adaptability, and problem-solving in a fast-paced environment. These skills translate directly into my work in design, where teamwork and user-centered thinking are essential. </g>
        <g>I bring my designs to life using tools like Figma, HTML, Squarespace, and Webflow, ensuring both aesthetics and functionality work hand in hand. Whether prototyping interfaces or building web experiences, I strive to create seamless, engaging designs. </g>
        <g>Outside of design, my hobbies include anything Pokémon, playing video games, and creating my own video games when my hyper-niche idea for a game doesn't exist yet!</g>
        <g>Whether it be about design, opportunities, or any hobbies we may have in common, shoot me a message! I'd love to chat :)</p>
