    <h1>Steam Mobile Redesign</h1>
    <p>The Steam mobile app is an essential tool for gamers, providing access to their library, the store, and community features. As a user of Steam, I was inspired to pursue this project and create a change towards an area directly present in my life. This redesign focuses on streamlining the experience, reducing friction, and making key features more accessible while maintaining Steam’s core identity.</p>

<div id="section">
  <h1>Problem</h1>
  <div id="right-paragraphs">
    <p1>The current design of the app presents navigation challenges, particularly with an overwhelming array of drop down menus and buttons, with there being a redundant and confusing display of information. Users often struggle to quickly access key features like their library, store, or friend activity due to cluttered layouts and inconsistent UI patterns.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Goals & Objectives</h1>
  <div id="right-paragraphs">
    <p2>Streamline Navigation for Mobile Contexts</p2>
    <p1>The original Steam app’s navigation felt cluttered and inconsistent, making it difficult for users to quickly locate key features like the store, library, or friend activity. On mobile, where screen space is limited and users often interact on the go, this friction was amplified. The goal was to simplify access to primary features, reduce cognitive load, and create a more intuitive path through the app’s core functions.</p1>
    <hr class="half-line" />
    <p2> Prioritize Visual Hierarchy</p2>
    <p1>The visual hierarchy in the existing design lacked clarity, with equal weight given to both primary and secondary elements. This led to confusion around what users should focus on first. In a mobile context, where attention spans are short, it was essential to restructure layouts to clearly guide the user’s eye by using size, contrast, and spacing to emphasize critical content like game updates, library access, or ongoing sales.</p1>
    <hr class="half-line" />
    <p2>Improve Menu Legibility & Structure</p2>
    <p1>Menus in the legacy app were overly dense and text-heavy, often buried behind multiple taps with little feedback. This created frustration when users tried to access settings or manage downloads. To address this, the objective was to declutter the menu system, reorganize items under clearer labels, and ensure visual consistency in font size, alignment, and iconography to support quick recognition and seamless use.</p1>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="fancy" />

<div id="section">
    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <div id="right-paragraphs">
        <p1>To meet these goals, I redesigned the Steam mobile app with a bottom navigation bar for immediate access to essential features, replacing the hamburger menu and buried links. I restructured the home and library pages to reflect a clearer visual hierarchy, spotlighting recently played games and community highlights with intentional sizing and contrast. The menu system was refined with fewer, more meaningful categories, enhanced icon use, and improved spacing for readability. These changes reduce friction, support mobile-first behaviors, and elevate the overall usability of the app. </p1>

    <h1>Unified Navigation Menu</h1>
    <div id="right-paragraphs">
        <p1>The redesigned hamburger menu consolidates all key functions—Store, Community, Library, and Account—into one easily accessible hub. This eliminates redundant dropdowns and scattered buttons, streamlining the user’s mental model and reducing cognitive load.</p1>
    </div>
</div>

<hr class="fancy" />

<div id="section">
    <h1>Simplified Top Bar</h1>
    <div id="right-paragraphs">
        <p1>The top of the screen now includes only two clear icons: search and menu. By replacing the previous shopping cart icon and relocating cart access into the unified menu, the interface becomes more focused and less visually cluttered.</p1>
    </div>
</div>

<hr class="fancy" />

<div id="section">
    <h1>Clean Homepage Hierarchy</h1>
    <div id="right-paragraphs">
        <p1>Game discovery is now more intuitive, with clearly separated sections such as Special Offers, Browse by Genre, and Featured & Recommended. This improves scannability and allows users to find what interests them without sifting through unrelated content.</p1>
    </div>
</div>

    <h2>Reflection & Concluding Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Redesigning the Steam mobile app helped me explore how simplifying navigation and improving visual hierarchy can transform a cluttered experience into one that feels intuitive and efficient. Key changes like unifying the menu and cleaning up the top bar reduced redundancy and made the interface easier to navigate. This project reinforced the value of purposeful design. Every adjustment, from layout to icon placement, aimed to support users in finding what they need quickly. If revisiting the project, I’d conduct usability testing and explore personalization options to push the design further. </p>
